## Predictive Maintenance System for IoT-Enabled Consumer Electronics

**🌟 Project Overview**

Welcome to the **Predictive Maintenance System for IoT-Enabled Consumer Electronics** repository! This project aims to revolutionize the way we maintain and monitor IoT-enabled devices by leveraging cutting-edge technologies like **Explainable AI (XAI)**, **Edge Computing**, **Federated Learning**, and advanced mathematical frameworks such as **Fuzzy Logic** and **Soft Set Theory**. 🚀

### 🔧 Key Features
- **Multi-Device Integration**: A unified platform to monitor and predict anomalies across diverse consumer electronics (e.g., ACs, fridges, washing machines, smart TVs).
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Provide clear, actionable insights into detected anomalies (e.g., "Compressor running 30% longer than usual").
- **Edge Computing**: Real-time anomaly detection with reduced latency by processing data locally on devices.
- **Federated Learning**: Train AI models on decentralized data while preserving user privacy.
- **Proactive Recommendations**: Offer actionable advice to prevent device failures (e.g., "Clean your AC filter to improve efficiency").
- **Fuzzy & Soft Set Theories**: Handle uncertainty and imprecision in IoT data for better decision-making.

### ⚙️ Backend Architecture
The system is built on a robust backend architecture that includes:
- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects data via MQTT, CoAP, or HTTP using message brokers like Apache Kafka.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizes time-series databases (e.g., InfluxDB) for IoT data and relational/NoSQL databases for metadata.
- **Data Processing**: Employs stream processing frameworks like Apache Flink for real-time analytics.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Deploys anomaly detection models using TensorFlow Serving or ONNX.
- **Alerting System**: Integrates with services like Twilio for SMS/email notifications.
- **User Interface**: Provides a web/mobile dashboard for device health monitoring and recommendations.

### 📊 Data Acquisition
The system leverages:
- **Sensor Data**: Collected from IoT devices (e.g., temperature, vibration, power consumption).
- **Synthetic Data**: Generated using simulations for testing and validation.
- **Public Datasets**: Utilizes open datasets for training and benchmarking.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values.

### 📚 Research Highlights
This project introduces several novel contributions to the field of predictive maintenance:
- **Generalized Framework**: A scalable solution for multiple device types.
- **Hybrid AI Models**: Combines machine learning with fuzzy logic and soft sets for enhanced decision-making.
- **Privacy-Preserving Learning**: Federated learning ensures user data remains secure.
